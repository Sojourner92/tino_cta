    This class collects one regressor for every camera type -- given by `cam_id_list` --

    The class interfaces with `scikit-learn` in that it relays all function call not
    exeplicitly defined here through `.__getattr__` to any regressor in its collection.
    This gives us the full power and convenience of scikit-learn and we only have to
    bother about the high-level interface.

    The fitting approach is to train on single images; then separately predict in image's
    energy and combine the different predictions for each event in one single energy
    estimate.

          camera types

    energy_unit : astropy quantity, optional (default: u.TeV)
        scikit-learn regressors don't work with astropy unit. so, tell in advance in which
